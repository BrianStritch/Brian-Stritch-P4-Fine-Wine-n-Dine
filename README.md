# Love Rugby shop
Love Rugby is an ecommerce rugby website allowing users to purchase rugby boots, jerseys and accessories developed for Milestone 4 as milestone project 4 as part of the Code Institute - Diploma in Software Development (Full stack) course.

    - A regular(shopper) user account has been set up with username/password of johnnysexton/Password456!
    - When making a payment as a regular user, a test credit card of 4242424242424242 has been set up for the card number
    - For the expiry date, cvc and postal code any series number(s) can be used(once they meet the mimimum values)

# Project Overview
- This project is a website is for submission as milestone project 4 as part of the Code Institute - Diploma in Software Development (Full stack) course.
- The website is deployed using Heroku pages at the following url: [Love Rugby](https://ci-ms4-loverugby.herokuapp.com/)
- The repository on GitHub that contains the website source code and assets is available at the following url: [Code Repository](https://github.com/pmeeny/CI-MS4-LoveRugby)
- The website was built with a responsive look and feel for desktop, tablet and mobile devices

# UX
## Strategy
### Primary Goal
The primary goal of the website from the site 
owners perspective is as follows:
- To add, edit and delete products with the relevant information (price, description, rating, comments, image, sizes and category) on the website 
- To allow a user make a purchase of the products on the website
- To categorise sale items on the website
- To add, edit and delete website news for publication to website users

The primary goal of the website from a site users perspective is as follows:
- To register for an account on the website and receive an email after successful registration
- To login or logout from the website
- To easily recover my password in case I forget it
- Have a personalised user profile with my delivery, payment information and order history
- View a list of products on the website
- View an individual product detail(price, description, rating, comments, image, sizes and category)
- To add an item to a shopping bag, and select the quantity and size if applicable
- Complete a purchase of items in a shopping bag
- To post a review(rating and comment) on a product
- To sort the list of available products by rating, price and category
- Search for a product by name or description and view the search results
- To view website news, and comment on a news item
- To have a list of product favourites and to add/delete items from the list

## Structure
### Website pages
- I have structured the website into over 20 pages, each with clear, concise structure, information and purpose. I use the Bootstrap grid system throughout, which gave a consistent structure and responsive design "out of the box"
- Below are the main page's/features functionality wise, there are some others for password reset/verification etc. that are described in the user story section 
- All pages have a common look and feel and a common header/footer. On a tablet/mobile the look and feel is slightly different with a burger menu
- These pages are described in more detail in the user stories section

## Surface
### Color Palette
I have gone for a simple and minimal design for the website, with predominately green, grey and whitesmoke font colours
There are five colours in the color palette
- 000000/555555 - Black and grey colours for the majority ot text on the website
- 1E5128 - Dark green for background and buttons
- DB4437 - Warning and sale item buttons and text
- 0B51C1 - Blue for links
- F5F5F5/FFFFFF - Whitesmoke and white for background colours

I feel the colours complement each other very well, and I choose those colours after testing a number of palettes while making sure the colour palette met accessibility standards.
![Colour Palette](readme/misc/color_palette.png)

### Typography
The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the Poppins font cannot be imported into the website correctly. This font is from the Google fonts library.

# Features
The website has twenty distinct features, and they are described below
What is important to detail is what pages are accessible by the three types of users
1. A user not logged into the site
2. A regular(shopper) user logged into the site
3. An admin(administrator) user
The navigation buttons update depending on whether a user is logged in or not, and whether that user is the admin:

9. Set Read access for the Bucket ACL for Everyone(Public Access)
10. The bucket is created, the next step is to open the IAM application to set up access
11. Create a new user group named "ci-ms4-rugby-shop"
12. Add the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy permission for the user group
<br>![AWS Bucket Policy](readme/misc/aws_user_group.png)
13. Go to "Policies" and click "Create New Policy"
14. Click "Import Managed Policy" and select "AmazonS3FullAccess" > Click 'Import'.
15. In the JSON editor, update the policy "Resource" to the following
<br><code>"Resource": [</code>
<br><code>"arn:aws:s3:::ci-ms4-rugby-shop",</code>
<br><code>"arn:aws:s3:::ci-ms4-rugby-shop/*"</code>
<br><code>]</code>
16. Give the policy a name and click "Create Policy"
